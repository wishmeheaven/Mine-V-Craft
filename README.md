Minecraft is a sandbox video game initially created by Swedish programmer, Markus "Notch" Persson .
The creative and building aspects of Minecraft enable players to build constructions out of textured cubes in a 3D procedurally generated world.

This version of the game made of 2D pre-generated world.

In this project I was supported by my friend Benjamin (https://github.com/MrBennySolomon), who was kind enough to introduce me to the MVC concept, as well as Local Storage.

1. The user will have 3 types of tools:

#### * Axe     - for cutting trees
#### * Shovel  - for digging dirt
#### * Pickaxe - for mining rocks   

2. Clicking on a tool followed by clicking on a tile in the
world will remove the tile. (If it is of the correct type
according to #1) and add it to the inventory.

3. Users can click on the tile in the inventory and place
it back in the world.
